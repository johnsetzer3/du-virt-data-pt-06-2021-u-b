# UFO Sightings and Javascript

## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide
a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple
criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for
the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Once navigating to the UFO sightings webpage, the client will be presented with the
basic webpage as well as a table of ALL UFO sightings:

On the left hand side of the page, there are different filters that have been added to filter the table based on: date, city,
state, country, and shape of the sightings.  Upon entering the search criteria in the blanks
of the desired filter, the webpage will show all of the sightings for that particular search.
Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously to further inspect the data as needed.

## Summary
For this challenge, I have created a webpage that looks clean and allows users to filter through
the different UFO sightings stored in the table.  One big drawback is the lack of validation for the
UFO sightings listed.  One recommendation to remedy that and further future development would be to
have a column for the number of people present when the claim was made.  This would help filter
out claims viewed as more of a hoax.  Another recommendation that would further the development of
this webpage would be to implement a real-time scraping function that constantly updates the
table with new data.
