# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
*In this project scenario, Louise's play came very close to meeting it's goal in a short amount of time.  
*Louise is interested in determining how different campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals
*I utilized Excel and its built in tools, such as pivot tables, line graphs, and statistic functions to analyze the theater outcomes based on goals along with the outcomes of plays based on launch date

Now we've looked at the different categories and compared countries of origin, which has provided a lot of insight into Kickstarter campaigns. Now let's consider time, or more specifically, whether the length of a campaign makes a difference in determining its success. For example, is a shorter or longer campaign more effective? Is there a certain time of year when campaigns tend to be more successful? We have the data, so let's find the answers.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to analyze the outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) of theater campaigns based on their launch date, I utilized pivot tables and graphing tools within Excel to determine if there is a trend in the length of a campaign and its success.  I created a pivot table using the outcomes as the columns and date as the row. The values were the count of outcomes in those specific parameters. The data appears clunky at first, but I was able to clean it up for analysis utilizing the filtering tools in Excel. Filtering the 'Date Created' value in the rows field, I set the value to display the month only.  By adding the Parent Category filter to the whole chart, I gather data pertinent to the theater based Kickstarter Campaigns.  Additionally, I added a Year filter to the whole chart to allow for more specific analysis of certain years, though I leave it on (All) years to allow for the most accurate data.

In order to make this data more visually friendly, I utilized a line chart, as they are typically more helpful when trying to determine trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals




### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
