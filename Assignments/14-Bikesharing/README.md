# NYC CitiBike with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine if the bike rental business is worth investing in for an alternate city.  One of the key factors involved in the decision is the trip duration of bike rentals in New York City.  Using data on trip duration, time of rental, and peak rental times, we can make an logical prediction on the success of the model in a different environment.

## Results
In order to prepare the data for analysis, I first had to change the csv data to append the trip duration column from seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.  Once the data was appended, I uploaded the csv into Tableau Public 2021.3 for desktop for analysis.

Using to visualizations created in Tableau, I found the following results:
* There were a grand total of 2,344,224 trips during the month of August
* From the total trips, 1,900,359 users were subscribers while 443,865 were normal customers
* There was a peak number of users who rent bikes for 5-6 hours at a time
* The largest number of individuals who rent bikes happen to be male
* Based on the Trips per Weekday(Per Hour) visualization, it appears that 5pm-7pm on Thursday is the most popular time to ride a bike
* Full project visualization available on my Tableau Public page:

## Summary
The big takeaway from this analysis is that Thursday is the most popular day to rent a bike.  Though males tend to rent more often, it appears the service is popular with both males and females.  Using this information, I can comfortably recommend investing into the bikesharing business in an alternate city.  To better improve the information to the client, one visualization that would be worth preparing would be to explore the number of trips and trip duration in the colder months, in order to prepare the client for the slower months.  Another vizualization that could prove useful is the average trip distance.  This would help determine the most ideal location for customers and could lead to more rentals out of convenience.
